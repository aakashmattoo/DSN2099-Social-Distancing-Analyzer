## **Hello beautiful humans!** <br>
I am Aakash Mattoo. I have mantained this repository on the behalf of my team. We have worked upon the project named **DE-SOCIALIZE** which is basically a Social Distancing Analyzer. The word "social distancing" has taken the world by storm and is changing the way we live. Distancing oneself from others has become a mantra that transcends languages and cultures all over the world. COVID-19, the world's fastest-growing pandemic, has forced us to adapt to this new way of life. The aim is to reduce physical contact between potentially infected people and healthy people. In order to obey social distancing, the WHO recommended that people maintain a gap of at least 6 feet between them.
